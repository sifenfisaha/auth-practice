## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-auth-app.git
cd react-auth-app
```
````

```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```

## Backend API Requirements

The backend should provide the following endpoints:

- `POST /signup`
  Accepts `{ email, password }` and returns success message.

- `POST /login`
  Accepts `{ email, password }` and returns `{ token }`.

- The token should include an expiration timestamp (e.g., in JWT format).

---

## Token Handling

- Token is saved in `localStorage` after login.
- A utility function checks if the token is expired.
- If expired, the user is automatically logged out and redirected to the login page.
- Logout also clears the token and auth state.
